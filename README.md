# Project-Option-B
Creates an LC-3 program that displays the minimum, maximum, and average grade of 5 test scores and displays that letter grade associated with the test scores. 

While our code did not succeed in the end, it had attempted to allow the user to input their test scores and those scores to be stored into an accessable array for the program. 
The array would allow each of the mathmatical loops to use an incremental pointer to pull values from the five test scores and calculate the minimum, maximum, and average grade. 

The minimum and maximum loops would use jsr and branching code, along with its mathmatical code to determine the highest value from two of the 5 values at a time. 
Storing the current highest and lowest in their respective locations to later be displayed to the user through output strings.
